// Since this is quite a few descriptors, this is a good time to remember that amount of descriptors per layout isn't problematic nowadays.
// See:
// * "One Set Design", slide 10 https://gpuopen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/VulkanFastPaths.pdf
// * "For Tier 3 do keep your unused descriptors bound – don’t waste time unbinding them as this can easily introduce state thrashing bottlenecks"
//    https://developer.nvidia.com/dx12-dos-and-donts  (Tier3 starts with Pascal (10xx) series with Nvidia)
// What _is_ expensive is a big descriptor _set_ layout, but wgpu limits us to 4 descriptor sets anyways :)
